It was based on the argument that <em class="ur">my life would be better if the quality of life of another person is higher. </em>This is because when somebody (or many people) are in a better position, they can create solutions that can directly impact my life and solve problems that I would no possible fix by myself.</p><p id="36a8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tx ty sd iy b tz ua fr ub uc ud fv ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq tj hw bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">For example, the quality of my life and the life of billions of people has improved because of technology, the Internet, search engines and mobile phones. But I didn’t create the internet, or Google, or the iPhone. It was because a particular group of people that had the basic needs covered, were able to innovate, get creative and find solutions that our fast-growing and interconnected world need it, radically changing how we live every day.

If you give people food, good, but if you give people education, job opportunities, you are changing that person’s life and of those around them. Providing food is not sustainable in the long term. Giving education/job opportunities is highly sustainable.</p><p id="c218" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tx ty sd iy b tz ua fr ub uc ud fv ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq tj hw bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">People that are creating technology are creating the future. So, if you educate people,<em class="ur"> in technology,</em> you are helping create the future. The world needs programmers, there is a well-known shortage of developers worldwide, and companies desperately need good quality engineers. Humankind needs to solve great problems that can only be solved through technology. It is also a well-paid job, so when people help to reduce the gap, when people contribute to technology communities, they are making the world a better place. For everybody.</p><p id="a82a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tx ty sd iy b tz ua fr ub uc ud fv ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq tj hw bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Because technology communities can thrive by themselves, a group of people with a code of conduct that respects and help each other.

This is how you change the world.</p><p id="be4b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tx ty sd iy b tz ua fr ub uc ud fv ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq tj hw bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Four years ago, I met two incredible people that had greatly helped and changed the technology ecosystem in Colombia.

And there he was, Julián, so helpful, so selfless and humble helping 8 girls that went that day to the meetup.

I started studying JavaScript in my free time, going to tech events, talking to people, getting involved, I met my very good friend Adrián, and NodeSchool for girls start growing! In a few months, the name was changed for Pioneras Developers, and now is the biggest meetup for women in tech in the country. We are <a class="ae no" href="https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/PionerasDevelopers/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">+1.100 women</a> ever learning, ever growing, ever improving and helping each other. I became one of the leaders.</p><p id="60eb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tx ty sd iy b tz ua fr ub uc ud fv ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq tj hw bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Then, I became a speaker on MedellinJS, there were 130 people in that meetup, and I was not an expert, but I was playing around with JavaScript, and I love contributing to communities, so why not? The funny thing is that they loved my talk. After that, I apply to be a speaker at EmpireJS in New York, and I got accepted! I was not even working in technology, and I was already a national and international speaker! 😱</p><p id="7948" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tx ty sd iy b tz ua fr ub uc ud fv ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq tj hw bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">I kept speaking at local communities, changed my career of business and focused only in technology, won a scholarship to study at the Recurse Center in New York (an amazing experience, an amazing community), start volunteering, then organizing and now co-directing JSConf Colombia, and I got my first programming job at Moove-it, an incredible company, where I have been working for the last year and a half.</p><p id="8176" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tx ty sd iy b tz ua fr ub uc ud fv ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq tj hw bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">As Juan Pablo Buritica, another incredible community hero said: the Butterfly Effect 🦋.</p><p id="0fee" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tx ty sd iy b tz ua fr ub uc ud fv ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un uo up uq tj hw bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">I think it is very important to never forget where you came from. When you get a certain degree of success is easy to believe that you are the only responsible for that success. However, the truth is that you wouldn’t be where you are if it wasn’t for countless people. So is important to be grateful, humble and have recognition of those people. Tomorrow I will start working on one of the top Node.js companies in the world, but I want to first recognize those people, communities, and company.</p><h2 id="6254" class="us ut sd bd uu id uv ie ft ih uw ii fx uf ux uy gb uj uz va gf un vb vc gj vd bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Moove-it</h2><p id="f601" class="pw-post-body-paragraph tx ty sd iy b tz ve fr ub uc vf fv ue uf vg uh ui uj vh ul um un vi up uq tj hw bi" data-selectable-paragraph="">Is so sad to leave Kommit/Moove-it, I truly loved working there, great people and projects, cool bosses, good benefits, and high-quality engineering.

In other words, to add value to society. You can literally change a life saying to a little girl, “hey, you can do it”.
